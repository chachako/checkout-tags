inputs:
  base:
    description: >
      Base (upstream) repository name with owner. For example, 'torvalds/linux'.
      
      If the value is not specified, the default value is the upstream repository of
      the current fork repository, and if the current repository is not a fork, the
      workflow will fail.
  head:
    description: >
      Head (fork) repository name with owner. For example, 'pop-os/linux'.
      
      If the value is not specified, the default value is the current repository.
    default: ${{ github.repository }}
  overwrite:
    description: >
      Whether to check out and overwrite the existing branches corresponding to the
      tags (in "checkout-tags/<tag-name>" format), otherwise skip them.
    default: 'false'
  filter:
    description: >
      Filter tags by regular expression. For example, the regex "^v[2-9]\..*" controls
      only check out tags larger than the "v2" version.
    default: '.*'
  stage:
    description: >
      Stage to be executed can be '1' or '2'.
      
      
      The action is divided into two stages. The first stage is used to detect the existence
      of tags that need to be checked out, and the second stage is used to check out tags.
      
      
      For example, the "up-to-date" output of the first stage can be used to determine whether
      the repository needs to be checkout, thus saving time.
      
      
      If the value is not specified, that means two stages are executed in order.
  stage2-tags:
    description: >
      Tags to be checked out in the second stage. This value should be the output value of the
      first stage. If the input of 'stage' is '2', but this value is not specified, the workflow
      will fail.
      
      
      The value is a string of tags separated by line breaks (\n).

outputs:
  up-to-date:
    description: 'A boolean value represents whether there is any new tag to check out.'
  tags:
    description: 'A (multi-line) string value represents the list of tags to be checked out.'
  branches:
    description: >
      A (multi-line) string value represents the checked out list of branches.
    
      All branches name are in format of "checkout-tags/<tag-name>", and all branches
      are checked out from the corresponding tags.
